This project is called Penguin Persuit. It was a
C++ project I worked on based on a 
Lumosity (http://www.lumosity.com) orientation
testing game. The goal is to race to the end of 
a maze faster than the AI compeditor. The challenge
is that periodically, the maze roates while your
orientation stays the same. It was cone in C++ and
DOS ofr graphics.
