This is a networked Hammurabi Game project.
An example of this classic resource management
can be found here:

http://www.hammurabigame.com/hammurabi-game.php

This project delegates specific responsibilities
two the two programs - client and server. The 
Server does all the game calculations while the
client handles the UI and player input.
